# Boat Reservation Project

## What is this project?

The Boat Reservation Project is a command-line application designed to simplify the boat reservation process. It allows both customers and managers to interact with the system and manage boat reservations. Customers can view available boat types and make reservations, while managers have additional administrative privileges to oversee and control the reservation process.

## Project Structure and Tools Used

The Boat Reservation Project was developed collaboratively by a team of five members, including myself. Each team member had specific roles and responsibilities. My primary role in the project was coding the reservation functionality.

The project was implemented using various tools and technologies, including:

- **Programming Languages**: The project was coded primarily in Java.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub were used for version control and collaboration among team members.
- **Development Environment**: We utilized IntelliJ IDEA for coding and debugging purposes.

## Project Development Process

The project was completed within a specific timeframe of 5 weeks. During the development process, we followed a collaborative approach, dividing the project tasks among team members. We maintained regular communication and held meetings to discuss progress, address challenges, and make necessary adjustments.

## My Contribution

As part of the Boat Reservation Project, I focused on implementing the reservation functionality. This involved coding the necessary features to allow customers to view boat types and make reservations. I ensured that the reservation process was user-friendly and efficient. By collaborating with my teammates, I integrated my work with the rest of the project, ensuring a cohesive and functional application.

## Project Results

The Boat Reservation Project provided me with valuable experience in command-line application development and working in a team. It allowed me to enhance my coding skills and gain a deeper understanding of the reservation process. Through this project, I learned the importance of collaboration, effective communication, and delivering a functional solution.

I am proud to have contributed to this project and successfully implemented the reservation functionality. The project helped me develop my skills as a developer and provided me with a solid foundation for future command-line application projects.
